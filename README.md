# Q-Learning CartPole Agent

This project implements a Q-learning agent designed to solve the CartPole environment from OpenAI's Gymnasium. The primary goal of the agent is to maintain the balance of a pole that is attached to a moving cart. This is a classic reinforcement learning problem, showcasing how an agent can learn from its interactions with the environment to maximize its cumulative reward over time.

## Project Overview

In the CartPole environment, the agent receives a reward for every time step it successfully keeps the pole upright. The agent's actions include applying forces to the left or right to control the cart's position. The challenge lies in balancing the pole, which becomes increasingly difficult as it tilts. The agent learns through trial and error, gradually refining its strategy to maximize the total reward it can accumulate over many episodes.

### Key Concepts:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving feedback from its actions in the form of rewards or penalties.
- **Q-Learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to learn the value of an action in a particular state. It does so using a Q-table to store the Q-values associated with each state-action pair.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
